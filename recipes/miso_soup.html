    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made from a base of dashi (a savory broth) and miso paste,
        typically served with tofu, seaweed, and green onions. It's a light, flavorful dish that's easy to prepare and
        often enjoyed as part of a Japanese meal.</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock) – you can use instant dashi powder or make your own</li>
        <li>2 tbsp miso paste (red or white, based on your preference)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tofu (cubed)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dried seaweed (wakame)</li>
        <li>1-2 green onions (chopped)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dashi:

            If you're using instant dashi powder, dissolve 1 teaspoon of dashi powder in 2 cups of hot water. Stir until
            fully dissolved.
            If you're using homemade dashi, simply heat the stock until it’s warm.</li>
        <li>Add Miso Paste:

            In a small bowl, take a bit of the warm dashi and mix it with the miso paste until smooth and dissolved.
            This prevents clumps in the soup.
        </LI>
        <li>Add Tofu and Seaweed:

            Add the cubed tofu and dried seaweed (wakame) to the pot. Stir gently and let it simmer for about 3-4
            minutes to heat through.
        </li>
        <li>Finish with Green Onions:

            Add the chopped green onions to the soup right before serving for a fresh, crunchy bite.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve:

            Ladle the miso soup into bowls and enjoy!
        </li>
