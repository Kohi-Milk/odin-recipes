    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p id="description">Yakitori is a popular Japanese dish consisting of
        skewered, grilled chicken pieces, often seasoned with salt (shio) or a
        savory sauce (tare) made from soy sauce, sake, and mirin. The chicken is
        typically cut into bite-sized pieces, and various parts of the bird,
        such as thighs, breasts, skin, and liver, may be used. Yakitori is
        commonly served as a street food or in izakayas (Japanese pubs),
        offering a delicious and smoky flavor from the grill.</p>

    <!-- 'Steps' heading / ordered list of steps needed to make the dish-->
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces
            (around 1-2 inch chunks). If using green onions, cut them into
            1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Make the tare sauce: In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce,
            sake, mirin, and sugar. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat,
            stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Let it simmer for
            about 5-10 minutes to thicken slightly. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Skewer the chicken: Thread the chicken pieces (and green onions,
            if using) onto the soaked bamboo skewers, alternating between the
            chicken and green onions.</li>
        <li>Grill the yakitori: Preheat your grill or grill pan to
            medium-high heat. Grill the skewers for about 4-5 minutes per side,
            or until the chicken is cooked through and has a slight char. Brush
            with the tare sauce during the last 2-3 minutes of grilling, turning
            the skewers to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove from the grill and sprinkle with a pinch of salt
            (if desired). Serve hot with extra tare sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
